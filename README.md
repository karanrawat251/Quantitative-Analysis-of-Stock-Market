# Quantitative-Analysis-of-Stock-Market

This is a project based on Quantitative analyse of stock market. 

In the stock market, quantitative analysis is a financial methodology that analyzes equities and financial markets using statistical and mathematical methods.

Here, I attached dataset(CSV file) with this depository in which these are included which must needed in quantatitive analysis:
Only Tickers of four Companies are GOOGL (Alphabet Inc.), AAPL (Apple Inc.), NFlX (Netflix Inc.), MSFT (Microsoft Corporation)
Ticker: The stock ticker symbol.
Date: The trading date.
Open: The opening price of the stock for the day.
High: The highest price of the stock during the day.
Low: The lowest price of the stock during the day.
Close: The closing price of the stock for the day.
Adj Close: The adjusted closing price, which accounts for all corporate actions such as dividends, stock splits, etc.
Volume: The number of shares traded during the day.

We may evaluate a variety of statistical ideas, such as time series analysis, correlation analysis, descriptive statistics, and more, in order to conduct a quantitative study. We could do the following possible analyses:
1) Descriptive Statistics: Summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for each stock.
2) Time Series Analysis: Trends and patterns over time, especially for closing prices.
3) Volatility Analysis: How much the stock price fluctuates over a period.
4) Correlation Analysis: How stock prices of different companies are related to each other.
5) Comparative Analysis: Comparing the performance of different stocks.
6) Risk-Return Trade-off Analysis: Analyzing the balance between the potential risks and rewards of different stocks, aiding in portfolio management.

Hereby, At the end I attached my python file.
